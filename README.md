# Tictactoe
	I have created a Tic-Tac-Toe game project that demonstrates my skills in object-oriented programming, user interface design, and game development.
	The Tic-Tac-Toe game project is written in Java .The project implements the traditional 3x3 game board, with players taking turns marking squares with their symbol (X or O) until one player wins by getting three in a row, or the game ends in a tie.
	The code is well-structured and follows best practices in object-oriented programming.
	Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to create well-designed and functional software using Java.
